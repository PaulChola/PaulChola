# 👋 Hi, I’m Paul Chola Bwembya Mumbi

I’m a **Junior Cybersecurity Analyst and Student** with a strong interest in defensive security, endpoint visibility, and understanding how systems behave under the hood.

I enjoy building **practical security tooling**, digging through logs, and turning raw telemetry into something useful for detection and investigation. I actively participate in **CTFs**, work on hands-on projects, and continuously sharpen my skills to prepare for real-world SOC and DFIR environments.
