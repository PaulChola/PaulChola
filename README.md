## My Projects 🛠️

Here are some of the projects I'm most proud of:

🛡️ Uriel SysGuard

The File Integrity Guardian is a Python-based system designed to ensure the security and integrity of files stored on a server or network. It utilizes hash functions like SHA-256 and SHA-3 to calculate unique fingerprints (hashes) of files and stores them in a SQLite database. The system continuously monitors the specified files and detects any changes or modifications. When a change is detected, it sends real-time notifications to administrators, allowing them to respond promptly to potential security threats. Additionally, the File Integrity Guardian incorporates YARA, a pattern matching tool, to scan files for specific patterns or signatures associated with malware or security threats. This integration with YARA enhances the system's capability to detect and respond to potential threats effectively. In the future, the File Integrity Guardian will be integrated with Wazuh and Sysmon for enhanced security monitoring and threat detection.
