## My Projects 🛠️

Here are some of the projects I'm most proud of:

# 🛡️ Uriel SysGuard

## File Integrity Monitoring & Threat Detection Tool

Uriel SysGuard is a Python-based **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** and **threat detection** tool designed to help security analysts detect unauthorized file changes and potential malicious activity on a system. The project focuses on applying real-world defensive security concepts commonly used in SOC, DFIR, and SIEM environments.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

File integrity monitoring is a critical security control used to detect:

* Unauthorized file modifications
* Malware persistence techniques
* Insider threats
* System compromise indicators

Uriel SysGuard was built to demonstrate how hashing, rule-based detection, and automation can be combined to strengthen host-based security monitoring.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

* 🔐 **File Integrity Monitoring** using cryptographic hash functions (SHA-256 / SHA-3)
* 🧬 **Change Detection** for monitored files and directories
* 🦠 **YARA Rule Integration** for malware and pattern detection
* 📊 **Security-Oriented Logging** for forensic analysis
* 🔄 Designed for **future SIEM integration** (e.g., Wazuh, Sysmon)

---

## 🧠 Skills & Concepts Demonstrated

* Defensive cybersecurity principles
* Digital forensics & incident response (DFIR)
* Cryptographic hashing
* Malware detection with YARA
* Python scripting & automation
* Host-based security monitoring
* Log analysis fundamentals

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Hashlib (SHA-256 / SHA-3)**
* **YARA**
* **OS & File System APIs**

---

## 🚀 How It Works (High-Level)

1. Selected files or directories are monitored
2. Cryptographic hashes are generated and stored
3. Files are
