## 🛠️ Featured Project — Uriel SysGuard

### File Integrity Monitoring & Threat Detection Tool

Uriel SysGuard is a Python-based **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** and **threat detection** tool designed to help security analysts detect unauthorized file changes and potential malicious activity on a system. The project applies real-world defensive security concepts commonly used in SOC, DFIR, and SIEM environments.

### 🎯 Project Purpose

File integrity monitoring is a critical security control used to detect:

* Unauthorized file modifications
* Malware persistence techniques
* Insider threats
* System compromise indicators

### ⚙️ Key Features

* 🔐 File Integrity Monitoring (SHA-256 / SHA-3)
* 🧬 Change Detection for files and directories
* 🦠 YARA Rule Integration for malware/pattern detection
* 📊 Security-Oriented Logging
* 🔄 Designed for future SIEM integration (Wazuh, Sysmon)

### 🧠 Skills & Concepts Demonstrated

* Defensive cybersecurity principles
* DFIR
* Cryptographic hashing
* Malware detection with YARA
* Python scripting & automation
* Host-based security monitoring
* Log analysis fundamentals

### 🚀 How It Works

1. Selected files/directories are monitored
2. Cryptographic hashes are generated and stored
3. Files are periodically re-hashed
4. Any hash mismatch triggers an alert
5. YARA rules are applied to detect malicious patterns
6. Events are logged for analysis or escalation

### 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PaulChola/Uriel-SysGuard.git
cd Uriel-SysGuard
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ▶️ Usage Example

```bash
python sysguard.py --monitor /path/to/directory
```
